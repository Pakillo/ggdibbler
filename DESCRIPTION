Description: A package for visualising uncertainty with the goal of signal
    supression. Usually, uncertainty visualisation focuses on expressing
    uncertainty as a distribution or probability, whereas ggdibble
    differentiates itself by viewing an uncertainty visualisation as an
    existing graphic that has been adjusted to incorperate uncertainty in
    the estimates.  You provide the code for an existing plot, but
    repalace one of the variables with a vector of distributions, and it
    will convert the visualisation into it's signal supression
    counterpart.
