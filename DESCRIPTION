Title: Adding Uncertainty to Existing Visualisations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Harriet Mason
Maintainer: Harriet Mason <harriet.m.mason@gmail.com>
Description: A package for visualising uncertainty with the goal of signal supression.
    Usually, uncertainty visualisation focuses on expressing uncertainty as a distribution or probability, whereas ggdibble differentiates itself by viewing an uncertainty visualisation as an existing graphic that has been adjusted to incorperate uncertainty in the estimates.
    You provide ggdibble with code for an existing plot, but repalace one of the variables with a vector of distributions, and it will convert the visualisation into it's signal supression counterpart.
